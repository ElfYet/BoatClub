In a server-side application, the config folder typically contains configuration files and modules that handle various settings 
and environment-specific variables. These files are used to configure the behavior of the server application, 
manage environment-specific configurations, and store sensitive information securely.

Here's what you might find in a config folder in a server-side project directory:
- Environment Configuration (.env files):
	- These files contain environment-specific configuration variables. They store sensitive information like API keys, database 
	connection strings, and other credentials. Each environment (development, staging, production) can have its own .env file.
- Database Configuration: 
	-  If your server application uses a database, configuration files might include details about the database connection, such as 
	host, port, database name, username, and password.
- Server Configuration:
	- These files might include settings related to server behavior, such as server port, logging configuration, or security settings.
- Third-Party Service Configuration:
	- If your application integrates with external services (like email providers, payment gateways, or APIs), configuration files 
	for these services might be stored in this folder.
- Security and Authentication Configuration:
	- Settings related to authentication methods, access control, and security measures can be stored here.
- Other Configuration Files:
	-  Depending on the requirements of your application, you might have additional configuration files for various purposes, 
	such as caching mechanisms, error handling, or feature toggles.
