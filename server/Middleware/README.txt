In a server-side application, the middleware folder is used to store custom middleware functions. 
Middleware functions are an essential part of server-side development, particularly in frameworks like Express.js. 
They allow you to execute code at specific points during the request-response cycle, enabling tasks such as request preprocessing,
 authentication, logging, error handling, and more.

Here's what you might find in a middleware folder in a server-side project directory:
- Authentication Middleware:
	- Middleware functions that handle user authentication and authorization. These functions can verify user credentials, validate 
	tokens, and protect certain routes or resources from unauthorized access.
- Logging Middleware: 
	- Middleware functions for logging requests, responses, errors, or any other relevant information. Logging middleware is valuable 
	for monitoring server activities and diagnosing issues.
- Error Handling Middleware:
	- Middleware functions that catch errors thrown by previous middleware or route handlers. These functions can format error 
	responses and handle different types of errors.
- Validation Middleware:
	- Middleware functions that validate incoming request data, such as query parameters, request body, or headers. Validation 	
	middleware ensures that the data meets the expected format and criteria.
- CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Middleware (Optional):
	- Middleware functions that handle CORS policies, allowing or denying requests from different origins. This is essential when 
	your server serves resources to multiple frontend applications.
- Request Parsing Middleware (Optional):
	- Middleware functions that parse incoming requests. For example, you might use body parsers to parse JSON or form data from 
	POST requests.
