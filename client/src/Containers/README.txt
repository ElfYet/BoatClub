In a server-side application, especially in the context of a full-stack web application using frameworks like Express.js, 
the containers folder doesn't have a standardized or widely-adopted meaning as it does in client-side application development, 
particularly with technologies like React.

However, if you choose to use a containers folder in your server-side application, it's a good practice to denote that the 
folder contains modules or files related to controlling the flow of data, managing business logic, or acting as a bridge between 
different parts of your application.

Here's a hypothetical explanation of what you might find in a containers folder in a server-side application, based on the idea 
of encapsulating specific functionality:
- Business Logic Modules - Files containing business logic:
	- Modules or files that encapsulate complex business logic, algorithms, or calculations. For instance, if your application involves 	complex calculations or data transformations, you might organize related functions or classes within this folder.
- Data Processing Modules - Files handling data processing tasks:
	- Modules responsible for processing incoming data, transforming it, and preparing it for storage in the database. For example, if 	your application receives raw data from external sources and needs to preprocess it before saving, these modules could handle that 	task.
- Integration Modules - Files dealing with integrating external services or APIs:
	- Modules that handle communication with external services or APIs, encapsulating the integration logic. These modules can manage 	requests, responses, error handling, and other aspects of integrating external services into your application.
- Middleware Modules - Files for custom Express.js middleware functions:
	- If your application requires custom middleware functions for tasks like authentication, logging, request validation, etc., these 	functions can be organized within the containers folder.
